<h2 style="margin: 0;"> About Me </h2>

<div style="margin-top: 1rem;">
  <p>
    I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Birmingham, expected to graduate in 2025. I am fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/business/mitra-kaushik">Professor Kaushik Mitra</a> and <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/business/staff/profile?ReferenceId=44664">Professor Pei Kuang</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research primarily focuses on empirical analyses in the fields of macroeconomics and finance, with a specific emphasis on understanding the implications of imperfect knowledge and its role in shaping macroeconomic policy decisions. Additionally, I am interested in the formation and learning of expectations within enterprises and households.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am on the 2025-2026 job market and will be available for interviews.
