<h2 style="margin: 0;"> About Me </h2>

<div style="margin-top: 1rem;">
I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Birmingham, expected to graduate in 2025. I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor Kaushik Mitra and Dr. Pei Kuang.

My research primarily focuses on empirical analyses in the fields of macroeconomics and finance, with a specific emphasis on understanding the implications of imperfect knowledge and its role in shaping macroeconomic policy decisions. Additionally, I am keenly interested in the formation and learning of expectations within enterprises and households.

I am on the 2025-2026 job market and will be available for interviews.
