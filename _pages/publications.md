### Bank credit constraints, expectation, and firm activities: Evidence from UK SMEs

Corresponding author, with Prof.Kaushik Mitra, Prof.Pei Kuang, and Prof.Tianshu Zhao

Abstract: Using longitudinal survey data of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the United Kingdom, we analyze empirically whether and how bank credit constraint affects SMEs' turnover expectation and their planned and actual investment activities. We find that SMEs facing financial obstacles exhibit more pessimistic turnover expectations. Furthermore, we uncover an important expectation channel via which financial constraints impact negatively SMEs' planned and actual investment on research and development and human capital.




### The Brexit Referendum Effect: Political Stances and Business Performance for UK SMEs

This paper is my individual work

Abstract: Using data from the Longitudinal Small Business Survey (LSBS), this paper examines the impact of the 2016 Brexit referendum on the operational expectations, actual performance, and investment decisions of UK small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The results highlight the significant role of firms' Brexit stance in shaping both expectations and investment behavior. SMEs opposed to Brexit displayed more pessimistic expectations and conservative investment strategies compared to pro-Brexit firms. Additionally, we find evidence that the referendum adversely affected SMEs' actual performance, particularly in turnover growth and per capita productivity. Domestic firms reacted more swiftly and were more negatively impacted in the early years following the referendum, while SMEs engaged in EU trade saw more pronounced effects primarily in the final year before Brexit, with those involved in bilateral trade experiencing milder impacts compared to firms focused solely on unilateral trade.
