### Bank credit constraints, expectation, and firm activities: Evidence from UK SMEs

Corresponding author, with Prof.Kaushik Mitra, Prof.Pei Kuang, and Prof.Tianshu Zhao

*Working paper*

Abstract: Using longitudinal survey data of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the United Kingdom, we analyze empirically whether and how bank credit constraint affects SMEs' turnover expectation and their planned and actual investment activities. We find that SMEs facing financial obstacles exhibit more pessimistic turnover expectations. Furthermore, we uncover an important expectation channel via which financial constraints impact negatively SMEs' planned and actual investment on research and development and human capital.

### The Brexit Referendum Effect: Business Performance for UK SMEs

*Working paper*

Abstract: Using data from the Longitudinal Small Business Survey (LSBS), this paper examines the impact of the 2016 Brexit referendum on the operational expectations, actual performance, and investment decisions of UK small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The results highlight the significant role of firms' Brexit stance in shaping both expectations and investment behavior. SMEs opposed to Brexit displayed more pessimistic expectations and conservative investment strategies compared to pro-Brexit firms. Additionally, we find evidence that the referendum adversely affected SMEs' actual performance, particularly in turnover growth and per capita productivity. Domestic firms reacted more swiftly and were more negatively impacted in the early years following the referendum, while SMEs engaged in EU trade saw more pronounced effects primarily in the final year before Brexit, with those involved in bilateral trade experiencing milder impacts compared to firms focused solely on unilateral trade.

### Tax Policy and Public Macroeconomic Expectations: Experimental Evidence from the UK

Corresponding author, with Prof.Kaushik Mitra and Prof.Pei Kuang

*Work in progress*

This paper studies how different tax policies shape public macroeconomic expectations using a randomized controlled trial in the UK. We plan to focus on expectations of key macroeconomic variables, including inflation and the Bank Rate, and to explore heterogeneity in these expectations across income groups under varying tax policy scenarios.
