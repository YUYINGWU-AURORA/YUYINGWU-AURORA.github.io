### Bank credit constraints, expectation, and firm activities: Evidence from UK SMEs

Corresponding author, with Prof.Kaushik Mitra, Prof.Pei Kuang, and Prof.Tianshu Zhao

*Working paper*

Abstract: Using longitudinal survey data of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the United Kingdom, we analyze empirically whether and how bank credit constraint affects SMEs' turnover expectation and their planned and actual investment activities. We find that SMEs facing financial obstacles exhibit more pessimistic turnover expectations. Furthermore, we uncover an important expectation channel via which financial constraints impact negatively SMEs' planned and actual investment on research and development and human capital.

### Brexit Referendum Shock and UK SMEs: Attitudes, Expectations, and Business Outcomes

*Under Review, ABS 3\* Journal*

Abstract: This paper examines how small and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs) attitudes toward Brexit shaped their behaviour following the 2016 referendum. Using panel data from the Longitudinal Small Business Survey for 2015–2019, I classify firms based on the views of business owners or managers regarding Brexit’s impact on their businesses. I then analyse how these attitudes relate to expectations, operational outcomes, and investment behaviour in the post-referendum period. Both turnover and employment growth expectations declined after the vote. Anti-Brexit firms reported more pessimistic turnover forecasts than pro-Brexit firms, while employment expectations fell sharply for both groups. In terms of actual performance, and despite the absence of major policy changes, SMEs experienced slower turnover growth and lower labour productivity after the referendum, regardless of stance, with effects varying by exposure to EU trade. Investment plans also weakened, with anti-Brexit firms more likely to postpone or reduce spending on research and development, human capital, and physical capital. The findings show that business sentiment can shape the economic effects of major political events such as the Brexit referendum and highlight the importance of accounting for firms’ attitudes when assessing policy uncertainty.

### Tax Policy and Public Macroeconomic Expectations: Experimental Evidence from the UK

Corresponding author, with Prof.Kaushik Mitra and Prof.Pei Kuang

*Working paper*

Abstract：As the UK faces mounting fiscal pressures in the aftermath of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic, higher taxation has become a likely policy response. This paper investigates how changes in personal income tax influence households’ macroeconomic expectations and financial behaviour, with particular attention to heterogeneity across tax burdens. I conducted a randomised survey experiment with more than 1,100 UK participants, combining a pre–post belief-elicitation design with varied tax policy treatments. In the short run, both larger tax increases and spending justifications raise inflation expectations, while in the longer run only substantial tax rises continue to matter, especially among high-tax households. These households also exhibit greater pessimism, anticipating slower GDP growth and higher public debt. I further examine the mechanisms underlying these expectation updates, although they differ across households and policy scenarios. Behavioural outcomes are consistent with these beliefs. Under higher tax increases, high-tax households report stronger saving intentions, whereas low-tax households are more likely to reduce consumption. Overall, the results indicate that tax policy shapes both expectations and forward-looking financial choices in heterogeneous ways.
